# Stack-prefix-notation-class
This code's purpose is the following:
1.You will give it a problem including variants and it will give you the result in prefix notation and it will change the prefix notation back to its normal form
2.The code is only for positive variants
3.The code considers your input to be correct(e.g. not having spaces between variants and so on...) otherwise it's not going to work
